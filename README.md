This repository hosts an R script designed for comprehensive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using RNA-seq data. The pipeline incorporates differential gene expression analysis, GO term enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis, offering a suite of visualization tools to interpret the biological significance of gene expression changes. This pipeline is particularly useful for researchers in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology, aiming to uncover the underlying biological processes and pathways affected in their RNA-seq datasets.


The script requires the following R packages:

clusterProfiler: For enrichment analysis and visualization of gene sets.
pathview: For pathway-based data integration and visualization.
ggplot2: For general data visualization.
wordcloud: For creating word cloud visualizations (optional).
BiocManager: For managing Bioconductor packages.
Additionally, organism-specific annotation packages (e.g., org.Hs.eg.db for humans) are required and can be installed via BiocManager.

Data Input
The primary input for this pipeline is a CSV file resulting from a differential expression analysis, typically generated by tools like DESeq2. This file should include:

Gene identifiers (e.g., ENSEMBL IDs).
Log2 fold changes indicating the expression difference between two conditions.
Adjusted p-values for the statistical significance of the observed changes.

Features
GO Term Enrichment Analysis: Analyzes gene lists for over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms across Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component categories.
KEGG Pathway Analysis: Identifies significantly enriched pathways from the KEGG database, providing insights into the biological functions and interactions of the genes.
Visualization: Includes various plots (dot plots, ridge plots, network plots) for an intuitive understanding of the enrichment results, and pathway maps annotated with gene expression data.

Usage
Install the required R packages.
Replace "drosphila_example_de.csv" with the path to your input CSV file.
Adjust the organism database (org.Hs.eg.db) as per your study organism.

Run the script in an R environment.

Customization
The script includes several parameters for enrichment analysis (e.g., nPerm, minGSSize, maxGSSize, pvalueCutoff) that can be tailored to fit specific analysis needs.
